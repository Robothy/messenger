# messenger
messenger is a tool which is base on Java programming language for sending multiform message.

As we develop a program, we need the function of sending message to our laptop or mobile devices automatically as the most time, so we have to spend our precious time on implementing the complex API from third-party services providers.

This project is aim to build a **integration**, **easy to use** message sending tool for Java developers.
